TFplanner
=======
Thermo-Floor Heating Mat Planner aka. TFplanner.

TFplanner is a web application developed for Thermo-Floor. 
Its goal is to act as a tool for planning the placement of heating mats in rooms of different shapes.

* Thermo-Floor website: http://www.thermo-floor.no/

It is developed by three computer engineer students at HIG:
* Olaf Aa. Berge
* Anders Bodung
* Christian Simensen

### Dependencies
* `Jquery` - http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js
* `Raphael` - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael/master/raphael-min.js
* `rgbcolor` - http://www.phpied.com/files/rgbcolor/rgbcolor.js
* `stackblur` - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Quasimondo/QuasimondoJS/master/blur/StackBlur.js
* `canvg` - http://canvg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/canvg.js
* `raphael.export` - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElbertF/Raphael.Export/master/raphael.export.js

### Installation
Apart from the dependencies, the application will need a stylesheet and index file equivelent to the ones supplied in this repository.
We have made a JS fiddle that illustrates how the different JavaScripts are included, and what HTML-elements are needed. 
This demo is somewhat faulty due to the styling not compiling well with JSfiddle.

* The program is developed on behalf of Thermo-Floor AS, a norwegian company. The logic pertaining heating mats and their
* placement belongs to the company and can not be used without Thermo-Floors explicit approval.
* Other parts of the program can be reproduced in accordance with the MIT license, but aforementioned logic must then be
* removed from the program before publishing. The rider provided below must then be included in source code.
