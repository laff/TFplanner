Thermo-Floor Heating Mat Planner aka. TFplanner.

TFplanner is a web application developed for Thermo-Floor. 
Its goal is to act as a tool for planning the placement of heating mats in rooms of different shapes.

It is developed by three computer engineer students at HIG:
* Olaf Aa. Berge
* Anders Bodung
* Christian Simensen

### Installation
Apart from the dependencies, the application will need a stylesheet and index file equivelent to the ones supplied in this repository.
We have made a JS fiddle that illustrates how the different JavaScripts are included, and what HTML-elements are needed. 
This demo is somewhat faulty due to the styling does not compile well with JSfiddle.
